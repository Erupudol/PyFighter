INTRODUCTION

PyFighter is a Fighting Game engine developed in Python using the PyGame library.
A majority of the functionality is precoded to allow game designers to create 
fighting games using only a text file and sprite sheets. Any more substantial changes
would require a programmer, but the engine attempts to be readable and easy to use.

CREATING A GAME

The simplest way to create a game in PyFighter is to dump your sprite sheets into the 
data directory and then edit datafile.txt. The syntax is a pretty simple but has a few quirks.
